#library function imager description: This Image processing Library is based on "CImg". 
It's a "fast image processing for images in up to 4 dimensions (two spatial
dimensions, one time/depth dimension, one colour dimension). Provides most
traditional image processing tools (filtering, morphology, transformations,
etc.) as well as various functions for easily analysing image data using R. The
package wraps 'CImg', <http://cimg.eu>, a simple, modern C++ library for image
processing."(Bartheleme S., 2020)

#library function EBImage description:
 "EBImage provides general purpose functionality for image processing and analysis. In the context of (high-throughput) microscopy-based cellular assays, EBImage offers tools to segment cells and extract quantitative cellular descriptors. This allows the automation of such tasks using the R programming language and facilitates the use of other tools in the R environment for signal processing, statistical modeling, machine learning and visualization with image data."
